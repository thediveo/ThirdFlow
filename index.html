		  <h2>About <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span></h2>

		  <img class="left" src="third-flow.png" alt="Third Flow plugin">

          <p>The <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin brings to you another way to develop customization
          <a class="ext" href="http://tiddlywiki.com/#Plugins">plugins</a>
          for <a class="ext" href="http://tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki&nbsp;5</a>.
          This plugin is not enforcing a specific development flow, it simply tries to help you when you want it
          to help you. Otherwise, it tries to stay out of your way.</p>
          
		  <p class="clear"></p>

          <h3><span class="fa fa-cubes"></span>Development Phase</h3>
          
          <figure class="taped-mid framed right rot-1" style="width: 40%;">
            <img src="third-flow development phase.jpg"/>
            <figcaption>Development Phase</figcaption>
          </figure>

    	  <p>You can <strong>develop your plugin directly from within your browser</strong>. A server-based
    	  TiddlyWiki instance running on Node.js ensures that all your source tiddlers are neatly stored
    	  in a clean and hierarchically organized folder structure.</p>

    	  <p><strong>Source code management is done as usual</strong> using your favorite source code management tool,
    	  such as <a class="ext" href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> and others. As the <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin structures your tiddler source files you get a
    	  well-organized repository structure at no price.</p>

		  <p class="clear"></p>

		  <h3><span class="fa fa-send"></span>Release Phase</h3>

          <figure class="taped-left framed right rot2" style="width: 50%;">
            <img src="third-flow release phase.jpg" />
            <figcaption>Release Phase</figcaption>
          </figure>
 
    	  <p>For <strong>packaging your plugin</strong> you finally simply run a shell script which packs the
    	  plugin tiddler and saves it to disk. Additionally, a demonstration TiddlyWiki is also created that
    	  guides your future plugin users through the process of deploying your new plugin.</p>
    	  
    	  <p>The neat trick here is that the <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin automatically
    	  removes itself from your demonstration TiddlyWikis,
    	  because you don't need and want it there.</p>

		  <p class="clear"></p>

		  <h3><span class="fa fa-smile-o"></span>We're Using It Ourselves</h3>

		  <p>Of course, we are developing our <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin using it ourselves, so
		  we use the same process it supports. And it is real Open Source. As the saying goes, eat your own dog food.
		  This one really tastes delicious. Even if you're not a
		  dog &ndash; but luckily, nobody will know on the Internet.</p>

		  <p class="clear"></p>

          <p>Experience the <a class="wiki" target="_blank" href="output/thirdflow.html">ThirdFlow
		  plugin</a> live in a demonstration wiki ... and learn more about how to use the
		  <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin in your own TiddlyWikis. Also contained
		  is background information on the exiting plugin and JavaScript module technologies that
		  TiddlyWiki 5 comes readily equipped with.</p>

          <h2><span class="fa fa-birthday-cake"></span>Developer Tools</h2>
          
          <p>Wait! There's even more in our <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin surprise box.
          Well, vi experts won't exactly be thrilled at what we have to offer. But for all us real browser-addicts we've added a
          few nice developer tools that should make your developer life more comfortable
          &ndash; while you are working on your next great TiddlyWiki plugin.</p>

		  <p class="clear"></p>
          
          <h3><span class="fa fa-edit"></span>Editing Your Code Made Fun</h3>
          
          <figure class="taped-mid framed right rot2" style="width: 40%;">
            <img src="third-flow codemirror editor.jpg"/>
            <figcaption>Convenient Coding Bliss</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Our <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin comes packed with some useful additional
          <a class="ext" href="http://codemirror.net">codemirror</a> editor
          functionality, ready to use. For instance, bracket matching, indication of the current line, and on top
          of that syntax coloring for JavaScript and CSS. What a bliss.</p>
          
          <p>To make your experience as seamless as possible we're able to store JavaScript tiddlers as plain
          JavaScript code files. This way you can edit them either from within your TiddlyWiki or in an external
          editor. The latter as you may have done in the past already when developing JavaScript macros and modules
          for TiddlyWiki. You know, we don't want to enforce a particular development
          flow so you can decide at any time to either develop in-browser or using an external code editor and switch
          back and forth as you like.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> in the future we hope to support warm reboots to make your life writing
          and debugging JavaScript code modules even more fun. At the moment you still need to reload you
          TiddlyWiki so that your code changes take effect.</p>

		  <p class="clear"></p>
          
          <h3><span class="fa fa-search">Find Your Code</h3>
          
          <figure class="taped-left framed right rot-1" style="width: 40%;">
            <img src="third-flow sidebar plugin sources.jpg"/>
            <figcaption>Clear View on Your Plugin Code</figcaption>
          </figure>

    	  <p>A new side bar tool gives you a clear overview over the plugin source you that are part of your
    	  plugin development project. The plugin sources view doesn't need any configuration. It simply shows
    	  all plugins which are not part of the core, that is, all inside the <code>$:/plugins</code> branch.
    	  And all this in a neatly way, with your plugins clearly standing out for easy reference.</p>
    	  
    	  <p>As another nice developer feature,
    	  we cut away the irritating long prefixes that otherwise eat up all your valuable screen space.
    	  Compare this with the stock System view, where you end up with a forest of unwieldly long and
    	  hard-to-read prefixes.</p>

          <h3><span class="fa fa-folder-open">Easily Organize Your Tiddlers</h3>
          
          <figure class="taped-left framed right rot2" style="width: 50%;">
            <img src="third-flow file storage setup tags.jpg"/>
            <figcaption>Organize Your Tiddlers by Tag</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>The <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin organizes all your tiddlers neatly into
          subfolders ... and you can easily configure it what organization you would like. And we even
          give you a nice control panel tab so you can quickly get up and running.</p>
          
          <p>The best of all? You even <strong>don't need to restart the server</strong> after you've made
          any changes in your configuration: the server automatically picks up your changes for how to
          organize your tiddlers into file system folders.</p>
          
          <h3><span class="fa fa-tags">By Tag</h3>
          
          <p>For instance, you can easily organize all the tiddlers for documentation and demonstration using
          the new feature "Tag-based Folders": tiddlers with a particular tag all get into their own subfolder (tag folder).
          Sweet, isn't it? You can even choose to use hierarchical subfolders inside these tag folders.</p>

		  <p class="clear"></p>
          
          <h3><span class="fa fa-sitemap">Subfolders or Flat? You Decide!</h3>
          
          <figure class="taped-mid framed right rot-1" style="width: 50%;">
            <img src="third-flow file storage setup basic.jpg"/>
            <figcaption>Drafts & System Stuff Well Organized &ndash; and The Rest Anyway</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>Even the the basic setting are only a control-panel click away: no need to fiddle with
          difficult configuration tiddlers just to change the name of the folder where you want to store your
          system tiddlers (all those pesky titles starting with <code>$:/</code>). Or changing the folder
          where all your drafts go into.</p>
          
          <p>Oh, and last but not least, you can even decide whether you want to store all your normal tiddlers
          either into the same folder without any hierarchy or to neatly organize them into subfolders and
          even more subfolders; like turtles all the way down.</p>
          
          <p>And for those that want their own folder organization not covered by our
          <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin: you can easily add your own so-called folder policies that
          control how your tiddlers get organized. No need to hack the existing code, simply write your
          own folder policy module following some few simple rules. Just refer to our default folder policy modules
          and you'll see how easy writing new organization policies actually is.</p>
